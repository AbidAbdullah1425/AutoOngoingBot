'''Create a Python Telegram bot that processes a video, splits it into 4 parts, extracts the bottom 1/4th of the video frames, and performs OCR on these cropped frames. Generate accurate timestamps for subtitles, format them into a .srt file, and send this subtitle file back to the user. Clean all temporary files during and after the process. Ensure that the bot is efficient, fast, and works within a small memory/CPU space (ideal for hosting on Koyeb).'''
